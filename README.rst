K&R Exercises
=============

This repository contains my answers to the exercises in Kernighan and Ritchie's famous book *The C Programming Language*.

Most of the exercises call for some well-defined piece of code, but some are prose and some build on top of previous exercises and some are open-ended with no specific answer.
Because of this, the answers are organized in ``answers.rst`` with instructions for compiling if necessary, and the code is organized logically with a tagged commit for every exercise so that earlier versions can be accessed.
